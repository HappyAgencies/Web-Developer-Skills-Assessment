The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used. It helps the browser render the page correctly.

### 2. Why is it important to use semantic HTML elements?

Semantic HTML elements provide meaning to the content and improve accessibility, SEO, and maintainability of the code.

You can add an image using the `<img>` element with the `src` attribute pointing to the image URL and the `alt` attribute providing alternative text.
