# Task 3: Create a Basic JavaScript Function

## Objective

Create a JavaScript function that performs a simple calculation and displays the result on the HTML page.

## Requirements

- Create a JavaScript file named `script.js`.
- Link the JavaScript file to the HTML file.
- Add a button to the HTML file that triggers the JavaScript function.
- Display the result of the calculation on the HTML page.

## Instructions

1. Create a new file named `script.js` in the root directory of your project.
2. Link the `script.js` file to your `index.html` file.
3. Implement a JavaScript function that performs a simple calculation (e.g., addition of two numbers).
4. Add a button to the HTML file that triggers the JavaScript function.
5. Display the result of the calculation on the HTML page.

## Detailed Explanation

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Creating the JavaScript File**:
   - Create a file named `script.js`.

2. **Linking the JavaScript File**:
   - Add a `<script>` element before the closing `</body>` tag in `index.html` to link the JavaScript file.

3. **Creating the JavaScript Function**:
   - Define a function that performs a simple calculation (e.g., `function calculate() {}`).

4. **Adding a Button to Trigger the Function**:
   - Add a `<button>` element to `index.html` with an `onclick` attribute to call the JavaScript function.

5. **Displaying the Result**:
   - Use JavaScript to update the HTML content with the calculation result.

## FAQs

### 1. How do I link a JavaScript file to an HTML file?

You can link a JavaScript file to an HTML file using the `<script>` element before the closing `</body>` tag, with the `src` attribute pointing to the JavaScript file.

### 2. How do I trigger a JavaScript function with a button click?

You can trigger a JavaScript function with a button click by adding the `onclick` attribute to the `<button>` element and setting its value to the function name.

### 3. How do I update HTML content with JavaScript?

You can update HTML content with JavaScript by selecting the HTML element and setting its `innerHTML` property to the desired content.

## Submission

Once you have completed Task 3, commit the `script.js` file to your forked repository and update your `index.html` file to link to the JavaScript file. Include a note in your README file explaining how to view and test the functionality.

Good luck and happy coding!
