## FAQs

### 1. How do I create a form in HTML?

You can create a form in HTML using the `<form>` element. Inside the form, add input fields using `<input>` and `<textarea>` elements and a submit button using the `<button>` element.

### 2. How do I style a form with CSS?

You can style a form with CSS by adding CSS rules targeting the form elements (e.g., `input`, `textarea`, `button`). Use properties like `margin`, `padding`, `border`, and `font-size` to style the elements.

### 3. How do I validate form inputs with JavaScript?

You can validate form inputs with JavaScript by adding event listeners to the form's submit event. In the event handler, check if the input values meet the validation criteria and display error messages if they do not.

### 4. How do I display error and success messages?

You can display error and success messages by creating HTML elements for the messages and updating their content and visibility with JavaScript based on the validation results.

## Submission

Once you have completed Task 4, commit the `form.html`, `form-styles.css`, and `form-script.js` files to your forked repository. Include a note in your README file explaining how to view and test the form.

Good luck and happy coding!
